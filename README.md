# BadWords
The built-in bad world filter on Campfire's Bot. This repo contains all of the built-in words we search for in messages and then delete if they're in messages. This filter has to be manually turned on through the Campfire Dashboard.

## Want to add some bad words? ðŸ¤¬
Open a PR with the bad words you wish to add to the list. 

## Want to use this list for yourself? ðŸ’ª
Go ahead! It's fully open source under the Apache License. 

# Just be aware that the banned-words.json file contains RAW and uncensored bad words. So, take a look with caution. ðŸ‘€
